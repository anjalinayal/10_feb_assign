    "Q1 Ans:-open() function is used for opening a file. There are various modes in which files can be open such as\n",
    "read , write, read write, binary,append mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "read (r):-The read mode ('r') assumes the role of the default mode for file opening in Python.When you open a file in read mode, \n",
    "you are granted the ability to exclusively read data from the file without the possibility of altering its contents. \n",
    "\n",
    "write(w):-The write mode ('w') opens the gateway to writing data into a file. When you opt for write mode, if the file already \n",
    "exists, its contents will be truncated—meaning all existing data will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary(b):-The binary mode ('b') emerges as the chosen ally when dealing with binary data—such as images, audio files, \n",
    "or other non-text files. Opening a file in binary mode empowers you to read or write binary data. \n",
    "The 'b' mode can be harmoniously coupled with either the read ('r') or write ('w') modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append(a):-When it comes to appending new data to an existing file without truncating its contents, \n",
    "the append mode ('a') springs into action. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and write(r+):- The read and write mode ('r+') proves to be a dynamic duo, \n",
    "facilitating both reading and writing data to a file. \n",
